NAME
----
boltd - thunderbolt device managing system daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
*boltd* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
boltd is the thunderbolt device manager daemon. Its goal is to enable
the secure and convenient use of thunderbolt devices by using the
security features of modern thunderbolt controllers. It provides the
`org.freedesktop.bolt` name on the system bus. boltd is autostarted
via systemd/udev if a thunderbolt devices is connected.

The thunderbolt I/O technology works by bridging PCIe between the
controllers on each end of the connection, which in turn means that
devices connected via Thunderbolt are ultimately connected via
PCIe. Therefore thunderbolt can achieve very high connection speeds,
fast enough to even drive external graphics cards. The downside is
that it also makes certain attacks possible. To mitigate these
security problems, the latest version -- known as Thunderbolt 3 --
supports different *security levels*: 'none': No security. The
behavior is identical to previous Thunderbolt versions.  'dponly': No
PCIe tunnels are created at all, but DisplayPort tunnels are allowed
and will work.  'user': Connected devices must be authorized by the
user. Only then will the PCIe tunnels be activated.  'secure':
Basically the same as user mode, but additionally a key will be
written to the device the first time the device is connected. This key
will then be used to verify the identity of the connected device.

The primary task of *boltd* is to authorize thunderbolt peripherals if
the security level is either `user` or `secure`.  It provides a D-Bus
API to list devices, enroll them (authorize and store them in the
local database) and forget them again (remove previously enrolled
devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or
removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically
authorized as soon as they are connected. A command line tool, called
boltctl(1), can be used to control the daemon and perform all the
above mentioned tasks.

The pre-boot access control list (*BootACL*) feature is active when
supported by the firmware and when 'boltd' is running on a new enough
Linux kernel (>= 4.17). The 'BootACL' is a a list of UUIDs, that can
be written to the thunderbolt controller. If enabled in the BIOS, all
devices in that list will be authorized by the firmware during
pre-boot, which means these devices can be used in the BIOS setup and
also during Linux early boot. NB: *no device verification* is done,
even when the security level is set to 'secure' mode in the BIOS, i.e.
the maximal effective security level for devices in the 'BootACL' is
only 'user'. If 'BootACL' support is present, all new devices will be
automatically added. Devices that are 'forgotten' (removed from 'boltd')
will also be removed from the 'BootACL'. When a controller is offline,
changes to the 'BootACL' will be written to a journal and synchronized
back when the controller is online again.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h, --help*::
  Prints a short help text and exits.

*--version*::
  Shows the version number and exits.

*-r, --replace*::
  Replace the currently running boltd instance.

*--journal*::
  Froce logging to the journal.

*-v, --verbosee*::
  Print debug output.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

*`BOLT_DBPATH`*::
  Specifies the path where the daemon stores device information,
  including the keys used for authorization. Overwrites the path
  that was set at compile time.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
On success 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
