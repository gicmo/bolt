SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*boltctl* 'authorize' 'DEVICE'
*boltctl* 'enroll' 'DEVICE'
*boltctl* 'forget' 'DEVICE'
*boltctl* 'info' 'DEVICE'
*boltctl* 'list'
*boltctl* 'monitor'

DESCRIPTION
------------

'boltctl' is the command line interface to interact with 'boltd', the
system daemon that manages Thunderbolt 3(TM) devices. It can be used to
query the state of devices as well as manage them.

Devices can be globally identified via their unique identifier
(uuid). All commands that take a 'DEVICE' identifier expect this
unique id.

If no command is given, it is equivalent to 'boltctl list'.

COMMANDS
--------

authorize 'DEVICE'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authorize a currently unauthorized device identified via its unique id
(uuid) 'DEVICE'. If a key is stored in the database itwill be used,
given the security level of the domain supports secure device
connection. Use 'boltcl list' to find out the uuid of a device.

enroll 'DEVICE'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authorize and record the device with the unique id 'DEVICE' in the
database. If the domain supports secure connection a new key will be
generated and stored in the database alongside the device name and
vendor name. The key, if created, will be used in the future to
securely authorize the device.

forget 'DEVICE'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove the information about the device with the unique id 'DEVICE'
from the database. This includes the key, if one was previously
generated.

info 'DEVICE'
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Display information about the device with the unique id 'DEVICE'.

list
~~~~

List and print information about all connected and stored devices.

monitor
~~~~~~~

Listen for and show changes in connected devices.
